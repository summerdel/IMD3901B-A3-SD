Context: ASSIGNMENT INCOMPLETE
- I will go over what I did and ATTEMPTED to complete.  


Overview.

As a collaborative experience, I tried implemented a chat function, and tried to make a open sandbox type of experience where players can generate a word and try and build it together.

As a competitive experience, I tried implementing a maytching colour game. The floor plane would change colours every 5 seconds, and the players (2) must comepete in who can press the button that matches the floor the first within the interval. The players would accumalate points.

Challenges

Firstly, my assignent is incomplete. 

The challenges came with trying to emit my functions into the experience/game logic. I had multiple iterations of what type of competitive experience I wanted, but could not properly implement them. My main challenge with this wa socket.io, I could not get the experiences to work under one app.js, or I did not understand the formatting.

My chat was working atone point and then in integrating the competitive experience, the chat was no longer displaying in the UI but only the terminal.

My socket.io server was the base of all of these challenges. 

Overcome


I looked over socket documentation, i found that there would could be rooms and ids for socket.io. In the future I would implement and debug the socket io server further, and better organize my routes in terms of that.
